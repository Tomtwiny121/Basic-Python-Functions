Exercise: Basic Python functions
Â© ExploreAI Academy

## In this exercise, we will explore the fundamental concepts of Python functions and how they can be used in practice. We will be led through hands-on coding exercises that will emphasise basic concepts related to building simple functions and utilising built-in functions.

### Learning objectives
#### By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

1. Understand how to use basic built-in functions.
2. Create user-defined functions based on specific needs.
